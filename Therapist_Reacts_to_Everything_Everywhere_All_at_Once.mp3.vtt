00:00.000 --> 00:03.040
This movie is an exploration of nihilism, right?

00:03.040 --> 00:06.320
The concept of meaninglessness, of there is no objective truth,

00:06.320 --> 00:11.040
there is no objective morality, that we're all just specks floating out in space.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.200
If nothing we do matters, then the only thing that matters is what we do.

00:18.080 --> 00:21.520
I think we're more alike than we're different, and there's more that unites us and separates us,

00:21.520 --> 00:28.960
but we forget that because, honestly, we may know some of what's going on, but none of us know.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.000
None of us have any idea what the heck is going on.

00:32.000 --> 00:34.480
And how crucial it is to be kind.

00:34.480 --> 00:39.520
Kindness and optimism, they're not the tools of the ignorant or the naive or the stupid

00:39.520 --> 00:41.280
who don't know what's going on in the world.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.800
This is drinking from the fire hose for two hours.

00:46.800 --> 00:47.760
And 15 minutes.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.880
And 15 minutes, and it is sublime.

00:51.520 --> 00:53.840
There's a very beautiful side to nihilism as well,

00:53.840 --> 00:59.760
which is that we are the masters of our own fates, and we decide what's right and wrong,

00:59.760 --> 01:03.760
and we decide, you know, what our actions are going to mean.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.320
Welcome to Cinema Therapy.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.600
I'm Alan Seawright, professional filmmaker who needs therapy, and that is...

01:17.600 --> 01:20.080
Jonathan Decker, licensed therapist who loves movies.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.360
What are we doing? What's going on?

01:21.360 --> 01:24.400
Alan Seawright I would like you to react to all the things.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.440
Jonathan Decker Everything?

01:25.440 --> 01:27.760
Alan Seawright Uh-huh. In all of the places.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.600
Jonathan Decker At one single-lingual time.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.080
Single.

01:30.080 --> 01:32.800
Alan Seawright One single-lingual time.

01:32.800 --> 01:34.240
Jonathan Decker Everything everywhere all at once.

01:34.240 --> 01:36.560
I take it because we have bagels as guests.

01:36.560 --> 01:38.880
Alan Seawright Our guests are the everything bagel.

01:38.880 --> 01:40.800
I put everything on a bagel and I gave it to you.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.480
Jonathan Decker I love it.

01:42.480 --> 01:45.520
This is my new favorite movie, and I'm not saying that just...

01:45.520 --> 01:47.200
Alan Seawright This is not recency bias.

01:47.200 --> 01:51.840
Jonathan Decker No, this is... I have a very thorough vetting process and my last favorite,

01:51.840 --> 01:53.680
310 to Yuma, was there for like 12 years.

01:53.680 --> 01:54.720
Alan Seawright Oh, a long, long time.

01:54.720 --> 01:57.280
Jonathan Decker Yeah. So that's not faint praise.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.280
This has everything I could ever want in a movie.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.640
Alan Seawright And it has it everywhere.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.320
Jonathan Decker It has family reconciliation.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.080
It has couples working through their issues.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.880
It's got existential crises. It's got...

02:06.880 --> 02:07.760
Alan Seawright A multiverse?

02:07.760 --> 02:09.680
Jonathan Decker A multiverse. It's got martial arts.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.720
It's got laughs. It's got tears. It's got everything. Like, it's fantastic.

02:12.720 --> 02:18.640
Alan Seawright It is one of the best films ever made. Certainly the best film of this year.

02:18.640 --> 02:19.120
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.160
Alan Seawright Not even close.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.320
Jonathan Decker Michelle Yeoh is a...

02:22.320 --> 02:25.760
She and her husband run a laundromat. She is an Asian immigrant.

02:25.760 --> 02:27.440
She's got a daughter that are not getting along so great.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.040
Her father's coming to town for his birthday.

02:29.040 --> 02:33.040
He's an old school traditionalist and her daughter is more progressive.

02:33.040 --> 02:36.960
And there's just a lot of family drama and a lot of work stress and a lot of tax stress.

02:36.960 --> 02:39.120
And then suddenly she gets thrown into the fact that,

02:39.120 --> 02:44.080
oh, there's millions of you in many universes and you have the ability,

02:44.080 --> 02:49.360
if you choose, to visit those universes or to take those skills upon yourself.

02:49.360 --> 02:54.080
Alan Seawright And by being a failure, you have the most power.

02:54.080 --> 02:59.360
Jonathan Decker You're capable of anything because you're so bad at everything.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.480
Alan Seawright It's... everything. This movie is everything.

03:02.480 --> 03:04.640
Here we go. We're just going to watch some stuff and we're going to react.

03:04.640 --> 03:13.840
And that's all. We're just going to go. Here we go.

03:13.840 --> 03:18.400
Michelle Yeoh You have to try and eat healthier.

03:20.400 --> 03:27.840
You are getting fat.

03:27.840 --> 03:35.440
Jonathan Decker She had some more profound personal stuff to say,

03:35.440 --> 03:36.480
and then she backed off.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.200
Alan Seawright Yeah. This is...

03:40.960 --> 03:49.280
as a person who spent a good chunk of my time growing up in China and other Asian countries,

03:49.280 --> 03:51.440
I have Asian aunties and that's how they said they love me.

03:51.440 --> 03:58.800
Jonathan Decker Your daughter's struggling with a lack of approval

03:58.800 --> 04:00.960
or just the lack of unconditional love, really.

04:00.960 --> 04:05.120
Alan Seawright I just... this one little scene,

04:05.120 --> 04:08.800
it's like a minute and a half. Most of it doesn't even have dialogue.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.040
And it tells you everything you need to know about what this movie is.

04:13.040 --> 04:29.680
Michelle Yeoh Filmmaking!

04:31.840 --> 04:39.440
We just watched so much story happen, and it was like a couple of simple shots

04:39.440 --> 04:44.800
and the juxtaposition of those shots and then a subtitle and then a super title,

04:44.800 --> 04:47.360
which is what it's called when you put a title up higher like that.

04:47.360 --> 04:48.000
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

04:48.800 --> 04:54.000
Alan Seawright And a big giant, the world's largest music sting ever.

04:54.000 --> 04:54.480
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.000
Alan Seawright And it tells you everything,

04:56.640 --> 04:59.600
not just because it says everything, it tells you everything you need to know about this movie,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.400
what this movie is, who it's about, what their struggles are.

05:02.400 --> 05:06.480
Jonathan Decker This feels like a good place to make my case for movies as the highest art form.

05:06.480 --> 05:10.880
And very often we don't see them as such because so few movies like fail

05:10.880 --> 05:14.240
to take advantage of the potential and they just kind of poop out content like,

05:14.240 --> 05:15.920
here, here's a thing for you to enjoy.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.600
But film, if you think about all the other art forms, right?

05:19.600 --> 05:23.920
If you think about, OK, stage acting and the power of the spoken word,

05:23.920 --> 05:25.440
the power of the written word, right?

05:25.440 --> 05:29.440
So you have screenwriting, you have the acting, you have the wardrobe,

05:29.440 --> 05:32.400
you have the production design, you have music.

05:32.400 --> 05:36.400
If you're a musical person or you're moved by music, it's there, right?

05:36.400 --> 05:39.760
You have dancing, you have martial arts, you have comedic timing,

05:39.760 --> 05:44.080
and you have, through editing, something that you can't get anywhere else, which is editing.

05:44.080 --> 05:49.200
Alan Seawright Yeah, you can't go from one thing to a completely other thing

05:49.200 --> 05:52.160
and juxtapose those two in any other form of media.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.160
Novels almost kind of sort of, but not really.

05:54.160 --> 05:57.440
Jonathan Decker All the other art forms coalesce and come together in cinema.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.640
Alan Seawright Movies are everything.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.240
Come on, it's right there.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.280
Jonathan Decker This is why it's cinema therapy, because it's the best.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.240
Alan Seawright It's so good. Also, television and video games.

06:10.240 --> 06:12.400
But we're not talking about those right now. It's just cinema therapy. Here we go.

06:14.800 --> 06:20.160
My dear Evelyn, I know you. With every passing moment,

06:20.160 --> 06:23.120
you feel you might have missed your chance to make something of your life.

06:24.000 --> 06:30.080
I'm here to tell you, every rejection, every disappointment has led you here.

06:30.080 --> 06:35.680
And to this moment, don't let anything distract you from it.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.640
That just speaks to my soul.

06:43.440 --> 06:44.560
Do you think this is funny?

06:44.560 --> 06:46.320
Jonathan Decker Jamie Lee Curtis.

06:53.600 --> 06:59.200
So, first of all, K. Hoi Kwan, who we know growing up in the 80s from The Goonies and

06:59.200 --> 07:00.880
Templewoods. Yeah, short round.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.760
Jonathan Decker But then he disappears for decades.

07:03.760 --> 07:04.160
Alan Seawright Yeah.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.280
Jonathan Decker And I learned in the making of this film,

07:07.280 --> 07:08.800
it's because there weren't roles for him.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.600
Alan Seawright Yeah, he just wanted to do more than he was getting,

07:12.480 --> 07:16.000
you know, cast for. I mean, there were very few roles to begin with and they were all

07:16.960 --> 07:17.840
things that he didn't want to play.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.480
Jonathan Decker And so he retired. He didn't do acting for decades.

07:20.480 --> 07:22.400
He did some stunt coordination, is what I understand.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.920
Alan Seawright And second unit directing and stuff.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.160
Jonathan Decker Yeah, yeah. And then and then he saw

07:26.160 --> 07:30.480
a crazy rich Asians and realized he wanted to get back in the game because

07:31.280 --> 07:35.600
there are some good roles there. And I'm watching this film and it is a revelation.

07:35.600 --> 07:41.040
Alan Seawright He look, Michelle Yeoh, rightly, is getting praised out the wazoo for this.

07:41.040 --> 07:47.120
Because her performance is dynamite and he walks away with every single scene.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.960
He is so damn good as the different versions of Waymond.

07:50.960 --> 07:51.520
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

07:51.520 --> 07:56.240
Alan Seawright And just what he has to do as each different version of Waymond, like

07:56.240 --> 07:59.920
each one has pathos, but in a different way. And it's just like…

07:59.920 --> 08:00.720
Jonathan Decker It's a different Waymond.

08:00.720 --> 08:03.760
Alan Seawright It is mind blowing how good this performance.

08:03.760 --> 08:07.440
Jonathan Decker Well, he's funny and then he's dramatic and then he kicks ass.

08:07.440 --> 08:09.200
Alan Seawright And he's a complete wiener.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.960
Michelle Yeoh Ah! What's happening in my head?

08:10.960 --> 08:11.520
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

08:11.520 --> 08:18.720
Alan Seawright And he's like, but he's just sweet. And then he's like the world's coolest man.

08:18.720 --> 08:19.280
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

08:19.280 --> 08:22.560
Alan Seawright At one point. And it's just like, oh my gosh.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.920
Jonathan Decker And I just feel like we were robbed of decades of amazing work.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.200
And it makes me very sad.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.400
Alan Seawright Yeah, for sure.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.880
Jonathan Decker That the rules weren't there.

08:31.760 --> 08:35.040
And it sounds like a lot of it was American rules. They didn't have

08:35.680 --> 08:37.840
for Asian men stuff he wanted to do.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.160
Alan Seawright Which is a crime. Hopefully,

08:41.120 --> 08:44.240
we get 30 years of absolutely unbelievable work from him.

08:44.240 --> 08:44.560
Jonathan Decker Yeah.

08:44.560 --> 08:49.360
Alan Seawright Welcome back to show business.

08:49.360 --> 08:49.360
Michelle Yeoh What is that?

08:49.360 --> 08:50.560
Michelle Yeoh I got bored one day.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.520
And I put everything on a bagel.

08:57.360 --> 09:02.480
Everything. All my hopes and dreams, my old report cards,

09:03.280 --> 09:06.800
every breed of dog, every last personal ad on Craigslist.

09:06.800 --> 09:13.040
Sesame, poppy seed, salt.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.960
And it collapsed in on itself.

09:19.280 --> 09:25.920
Because you see, when you really put everything on a bagel, it becomes this.

09:25.920 --> 09:29.200
Come on, come on, come on. The truth.

09:29.200 --> 09:34.320
Yes. What is the truth?

09:34.320 --> 09:37.280
Michelle Yeoh Nothing

09:39.920 --> 09:40.480
matters.

09:40.480 --> 09:44.480
Alan Seawright Oh, Joy,

09:46.240 --> 09:47.600
you don't believe that?

09:47.600 --> 09:50.720
Michelle Yeoh Feels nice, doesn't it?

09:50.720 --> 09:58.640
Alan Seawright If nothing matters, then all the pain and guilt you feel

09:58.640 --> 10:03.520
from making nothing of your life goes away.

10:03.520 --> 10:12.960
Michelle Yeoh Sucked into

10:12.960 --> 10:19.360
a bagel.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.360
Alan Seawright So amazing.

10:27.680 --> 10:31.760
F***ing cinema! Come on!

10:32.560 --> 10:37.920
That was the objectively silliest thing that has ever happened.

10:37.920 --> 10:44.160
Alan Seawright And it's so emotionally impactful and she's crying while singing

10:44.880 --> 10:48.800
Sucked into a bagel. And so am I.

10:52.560 --> 10:54.800
I love this movie. I love this movie.

10:54.800 --> 10:58.560
Alan Seawright So do I. I'm loving it a bit more calmly over here.

10:58.560 --> 11:00.560
Alan Seawright I cannot love things calmly.

11:01.200 --> 11:02.720
I must love things ferociously.

11:02.720 --> 11:09.280
What did he say? This movie is an exploration of nihilism. The concept of meaninglessness,

11:10.080 --> 11:14.720
there is no objective truth, there is no objective morality, that we're all just

11:14.720 --> 11:16.400
specks floating out in space.

11:16.400 --> 11:17.680
You're the one holding the speck.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.000
I'm the one holding the speck.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.640
I'm the one holding the speck.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.200
Alan Seawright That none of it was created. There's no divine purpose.

11:25.200 --> 11:28.400
There's no. And that's where the daughter as Jobu Tupaki has landed.

11:29.040 --> 11:30.880
Not only is everything meaningless.

11:30.880 --> 11:32.880
This is Juju Tupaka.

11:32.880 --> 11:33.360
Jobu Tupaki.

11:33.360 --> 11:34.880
You're just making up the sounds.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.840
Alan Seawright But we don't have any sort of moral obligation to one another.

11:37.840 --> 11:38.240
Alan Seawright Right.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.760
Alan Seawright There's no impetus to do right because there's no divine reward.

11:41.760 --> 11:44.960
Like, so she's just going to wreak havoc and destroy.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.880
Alan Seawright She's going to put everything on the bagel.

11:46.880 --> 11:47.600
Alan Seawright Yeah, I mean.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.760
Alan Seawright All universes, all of everything.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.720
Alan Seawright She's a lot like Heath Ledger's Joker. She's an agent of chaos.

11:52.720 --> 11:53.040
Alan Seawright Yeah.

11:53.040 --> 11:56.320
Alan Seawright Except for she has far more power than Heath Ledger's Joker.

11:56.320 --> 11:58.160
Alan Seawright Much, much more frightening.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.120
Alan Seawright So she wreaks much more chaos is the scene.

12:01.120 --> 12:04.960
Oh, man, the scene is probably my favorite movie scene now.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.640
Alan Seawright Of any film ever?

12:06.640 --> 12:07.920
Alan Seawright Yeah, no, it speaks to me.

12:07.920 --> 12:14.320
Alan Seawright Also, the answer to is it possible for any

12:14.320 --> 12:16.400
human to be cooler than Tony Leung?

12:16.400 --> 12:29.200
Alan Seawright Maybe.

12:29.200 --> 12:34.240
Alan Seawright Can we just stop fighting?

12:34.240 --> 12:35.200
Alan Seawright He also plays this.

12:35.200 --> 12:36.160
Alan Seawright So much range.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.200
Alan Seawright So much range.

12:37.200 --> 12:53.040
Alan Seawright I know you're all fighting because you're scared and confused.

12:53.040 --> 12:57.200
Alan Seawright I'm confused too.

12:57.200 --> 13:02.240
Alan Seawright All day.

13:02.240 --> 13:06.320
Alan Seawright I don't know what the heck is going on.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.840
Alan Seawright I feel that sometimes.

13:07.840 --> 13:13.520
Alan Seawright But somehow it feels like it's all my fault.

13:13.520 --> 13:14.720
Alan Seawright Definitely felt that.

13:14.720 --> 13:15.680
Alan Seawright Definitely feel that.

13:15.680 --> 13:40.080
Alan Seawright The only thing I do know is that we have to be kind.

13:40.080 --> 13:52.320
Alan Seawright Please be kind, especially when we don't know what's going on.

13:52.320 --> 14:05.680
Alan Seawright This is such a powerful line.

14:05.680 --> 14:13.040
Alan Seawright And then it comes.

14:13.040 --> 14:21.120
Alan Seawright Did we. Oh, did we crack him?

14:21.120 --> 14:21.840
Alan Seawright Yeah, you did.

14:21.840 --> 14:24.800
Alan Seawright Hey, that's what I was going for.

14:24.800 --> 14:29.680
I'm obviously going to be if I think about this for two seconds, I'm going to be weeping openly.

14:29.680 --> 14:35.840
Alan Seawright My life mission inherited from my mother at

14:35.840 --> 14:40.080
large, the idea of, you know, we need to be kind, especially when we don't know what's

14:40.080 --> 14:47.360
going on. And I, you know, I believe that the principles of therapy will help on a societal

14:47.360 --> 14:53.280
level, not just in our homes. There's so much whatever side of the political or other aisle

14:53.280 --> 14:58.480
you're on, there's misinformation, there's people pulling strings, there's confusion,

14:58.480 --> 15:02.640
and there's finger pointing. And I think we're more alike than we're different. And there's

15:02.640 --> 15:09.520
more that unites us and separates us. But we forget that because honestly, we may know some

15:09.520 --> 15:14.640
of what's going on, but none of us none of us have any idea what the heck is going on

15:14.640 --> 15:20.000
and how crucial it is to be kind. I am not an optimist because I'm naive and I'm not an

15:20.000 --> 15:26.800
optimist because I'm clueless. Like, yeah, I've had a very blessed, privileged life. I came from

15:26.800 --> 15:34.480
a very happy family. But I've had, as an adult, I've had some hard losses and some hard hits.

15:35.360 --> 15:39.280
And then a lot of just the people that I work with, the things that I sit with every day,

15:40.240 --> 15:45.680
the sheer amount of darkness and ugliness. And there are days when I just come home and cry,

15:45.680 --> 15:48.720
especially when I deal with stuff that has to do with kids and what kids have been through.

15:48.720 --> 15:54.960
It just, and I have a very cynical side that you don't see a lot on the show and that people

15:54.960 --> 16:00.800
don't see a lot in life. I have a dark, frankly didn't exist when we were roommates. No, it didn't.

16:01.600 --> 16:08.080
It was, it was eye-opening to get to know you later as an adult and be like, oh, some went down.

16:09.200 --> 16:16.720
I've come to the brink of hopelessness a lot of times. Yeah. And so I love the line of,

16:19.440 --> 16:20.560
of this is how I fight.

16:20.560 --> 16:26.720
That kindness and optimism, they're not the tools of the ignorant or the naive or the stupid who

16:26.720 --> 16:34.160
don't know what's going on in the world. That, that this character, he, he presents as sunny

16:34.160 --> 16:40.080
and optimistic. And so his wife thinks that he's a dope. Yeah. But he knows what's going on. But

16:40.080 --> 16:50.240
this is how he chooses to fight. And I, I love Evelyn having that shift that through the different

16:50.240 --> 16:56.240
universes, whether he's this cool Tony Leung, like in the mood for love style, like smoking a cigarette

16:56.240 --> 17:03.200
version or this kind of dopey, he's wearing a, he's wearing a fanny pack, you know, and that she,

17:03.200 --> 17:10.080
she's like, well, we've got to, you can't back down from the challenges of life. And she always

17:10.080 --> 17:15.120
thought that he was, and he was just taking a different angle at him. Like, it's just so awesome.

17:15.920 --> 17:22.880
A, absolutely nailed it. B, they do it in the most hilarious, but also badass way. She like

17:22.880 --> 17:29.280
fights her way through a, you know, a rank of bad guys up the stairs, and she's like, oh,

17:29.280 --> 17:38.640
oh, you know, a rank of bad guys up the stairs using kindness fighting. Like she's just fixing

17:38.640 --> 17:44.640
all their problems using like weird ass kung fu. Well, there's one guy that she fixes his back,

17:44.640 --> 17:48.000
right? And then there's another guy. Doesn't she give someone something to eat or something

17:48.000 --> 17:52.160
like that? I don't remember. I have to watch it again. Oh man. But it's, it's, that's, it's

17:52.160 --> 17:55.120
everything. There's too many things. I can't remember all the things that she does. Well,

17:55.120 --> 17:59.600
she weighs into battle and her husband, who has been begging them to stop fighting, asks her to

17:59.600 --> 18:02.560
stop and she says, okay, I'm going to fight how you fight. I'm going to fight how you fight. And

18:02.560 --> 18:06.480
then she's like, well, and then everyone's just like happily on the stairs or like whatever.

18:07.360 --> 18:11.600
We are so excited to announce that we are launching a Patreon. So if you want to support

18:11.600 --> 18:16.400

18:16.400 --> 18:22.400
life, like extended cuts of episodes, exclusive discord server access, exciting behind the scenes

18:22.400 --> 18:28.640
and bloopers, extra crying with Alan and a whole lot more. I apologize. I used to do car commercials.

18:28.640 --> 18:34.000
Go check out our Patreon at patreon.com forward slash cinema therapy. Your support helps us keep

18:34.000 --> 18:40.000
making the show and you get to see me cry more and feel less alone in an infinite uncaring universe.

18:42.000 --> 18:46.960
That's good. Great. Mom, just stop.

18:46.960 --> 18:56.400
You're good for you. You're figuring your out. That's great. I'm really, really happy for you.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.760
She owned that her daughter is in a lesbian relationship and that she loves her and that

18:59.760 --> 19:07.040
she loves her partner. I'm tired. To the grandfather. I don't want to hurt anymore.

19:07.040 --> 19:13.280
And for some reason for her, it's too late. It just hurts the both of us.

19:13.280 --> 19:20.560
Michelle Yeoh's reaction there. So let's just go our separate ways, okay? Good acting.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.240
Just let me go.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.640
So this version of the daughter, obviously not a supervillain, but just wants to sink into the

19:34.640 --> 19:42.560
abyss. Yeah. And the supervillain version wants the same thing. But for everything. Yeah. For her

19:42.560 --> 19:52.400
and everything else stop existing. And so does the rock version, which I loved so much. The rocks.

19:53.600 --> 20:01.360
It's nice here. They have a whole dialogue scene as rocks with just subtitles in it.

20:01.360 --> 20:08.240
It's incredible. What's funny and amazing is this is still very moving, even though it's

20:08.240 --> 20:13.920
objectively silly. There are miracles happening in this film, miracles of filmmaking, things that

20:13.920 --> 20:27.120
should not work. Wait. You are getting fat. And you never call me, even though we have a family

20:27.120 --> 20:33.920
plan. What? And it's free. You only visit when you need something. You got a tattoo and I don't care

20:33.920 --> 20:39.760
if it's supposed to represent our family. You know I hate tattoos and of all the places I could be,

20:40.720 --> 20:47.440
why would I want to be here with you? Yes, you're right. That doesn't make sense. Evelyn.

20:49.520 --> 20:50.320
Let her finish.

20:53.680 --> 21:00.400
Maybe it's like you said. Maybe there is something out there. Some new discovery

21:00.400 --> 21:06.320
that will make us feel like even small pieces of s**t. The nihilism, you know, we. Something that

21:06.320 --> 21:12.560
explains why. Our insignificant specs. You still weren't looking for me through all of this noise.

21:15.680 --> 21:21.440
And why? No matter what, I still want to be here with you.

21:21.440 --> 21:30.000
I will always. Always. Want to be here with you.

21:30.000 --> 21:49.600
Want to be here with you. So what? You're just going to ignore everything else? You could be anything, anywhere.

21:49.600 --> 21:59.360
You might not go somewhere where your. Where your daughter is more than just.

22:02.000 --> 22:08.240
This. Here all we get are a few

22:08.240 --> 22:24.240
specks of time where any of this actually makes any sense. Then I will cherish these few specks of time.

22:27.120 --> 22:31.520
That's the secret. Yeah. If nothing matters, then everything matters.

22:31.520 --> 22:36.160
You know, speaking of laughter through tears, I love the acting choice of the daughter to

22:36.160 --> 22:40.960
to laugh as she's crying to her mom. And it's not especially happy, but the hot dog fingers. Oh gosh.

22:42.960 --> 22:49.440
And then the whole Ratatouille like spoof like is so awesome.

22:49.440 --> 22:58.400
Yeah. Grandpa wrapping his head around his granddaughter, dating a girl.

22:58.400 --> 23:17.360
What did he say? She goes after her cinema, man. Come on. You cannot do this with anything else.

23:17.360 --> 23:26.880
Certainly shouldn't be doing that with anything else. In one universe, her enemy is her lover, the

23:26.880 --> 23:34.320
Rekka Kuti. Like it's all so. It's amazing to me. The bonkers stuff this movie gets away with.

23:34.320 --> 23:42.320
None of it should work. It's just so amazing. It's just so amazing. It's just so amazing.

23:42.320 --> 23:47.520
It's amazing to me. The bonkers stuff this movie gets away with. None of it should work.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.280
And all of it is perfect. Yeah.

23:49.280 --> 24:10.080
There was an episode of of Angel, the TV series where they explore a similar theme.

24:10.080 --> 24:20.080
There it is. Powerful effect in the world. Close ups.

24:20.080 --> 24:36.080
So awkward. That's Sophie right there. But we're feeling happiness.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.120
Nothing matters.

24:43.120 --> 24:49.360
You know, I'm, I have a great interest in understanding how other people think,

24:49.360 --> 24:53.280
how they see the world. Sure. It's of great value to me as a therapist,

24:53.280 --> 24:57.600
not to impose my worldview on other people, but to understand where they're coming from

24:57.600 --> 25:00.640
and then help them within that framework. And so I was looking into nihilism.

25:02.080 --> 25:09.120
And in that episode of Angel, they say that if nothing we do matters, then the only thing

25:09.120 --> 25:14.640
that matters is what we do, right? That if there's no cosmic purpose, if there's no eternal reward or

25:14.640 --> 25:21.200
payout, then we're not, you don't help people for an eternal reward. You help people because

25:21.760 --> 25:24.320
they're going to be gone and you're going to be gone. And you've got one shot to make a

25:24.320 --> 25:29.040
difference in their lives. There's only this one chance to do anything good.

25:29.040 --> 25:33.600
Yeah. There's a very beautiful side to nihilism as well, which is that we are,

25:33.600 --> 25:40.160
we are the masters of our own fates and we decide what's right and wrong. And we decide,

25:41.120 --> 25:45.360
you know, what our actions are going to mean. The bar keeps getting raised on this,

25:45.360 --> 25:50.640
but this is the most movie ever in a movie. Yeah. This is drinking from the firehose.

25:50.640 --> 25:57.040
Yeah. For two hours. And 15 minutes. And 15 minutes. And it is sublime.

25:57.040 --> 26:05.280
It's a real sweet spot because it is simultaneously extremely intelligent and extremely dumb.

26:06.080 --> 26:10.320
And absolutely beautiful and like full of pathos.

26:10.320 --> 26:14.000
Very moving. And then at the same time, it feeds your-

26:14.000 --> 26:15.520
Unbelievably silly.

26:15.520 --> 26:18.560
And I just need to see some ass get kicked, you know, like it's all just in there.

26:18.560 --> 26:24.960
This is so much movie. I have a feeling we could do several more episodes. First one that comes to

26:24.960 --> 26:28.800
mind obviously is a movie couples therapy with Waymond and Evelyn. Do you want to do that?

26:28.800 --> 26:29.680
I would love to do that.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.400
Okay. Let us know in the comments below if you would like us,

26:32.400 --> 26:36.320
if you would like Jono to do movie couples therapy on Waymond and Evelyn.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.440
Do we want, you know, just like mother daughter therapy?

26:39.440 --> 26:41.600
Like that's a type of therapy you've done before.

26:42.240 --> 26:43.440
Yeah, for sure.

26:43.440 --> 26:45.840
Child therapy with Evelyn and Joy.

26:45.840 --> 26:49.040
I could, I could even do a villain therapy for-

26:49.040 --> 26:50.800
For Joba Tupac?

26:50.800 --> 26:54.480
Well, and for Jamie Lee Curtis's character.

26:54.480 --> 26:56.160
Oh my goodness. Yes.

26:57.520 --> 27:00.400
Yeah. Anyway, we want to keep talking about this movie forever.

27:00.400 --> 27:04.080
Let us know if you want us to, or if this was dumb and you hate us now.

27:04.080 --> 27:07.840
Wow. Or somewhere in between, like maybe not such extreme options.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.200
So until next time.

27:09.200 --> 27:12.160
Be kind. Especially when we don't know what's going on.

27:12.880 --> 27:13.520
Hey Jonathan.

27:15.920 --> 27:16.420
Bagel.

27:16.420 --> 27:26.420
And.
